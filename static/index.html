                            Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital currency.
                            This means Bitcoin works without any kind of central bank or administrative system.
                            <br/>
                            In 2008, an unknown person or group published a paper describing a digital currency under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. One year later, a reference implementation was made available as an open source-project by them.
                            <br/>
                            Bitcoin works by using a public distributed ledger (called blockchain) that allows clients to place transactions to be recorded by the network. It takes approximately 10 minutes to pass a transaction using the current system.
                            <br/>
                            Each person that wants to trade Bitcoins uses a client that connects to the Bitcoin network. The client manages the distributed ledger and the communication with the rest of the network.

                            Because the ledger is public, everybody can pass transactions using it. We then need some way to validate that a transaction is authentic, otherwise people could steal each other's money by lying on the ledger. This is made possible thanks to cryptography and the concept of signatures.
                            <br/>
                            But somebody might still be able to lie to somebody else. If I owe you money, I could tell your client that I actually gave it to you but keep this information from the rest of the network. That way, everyone but you will believe I still have the same amount of money as before. Hence the idea of the Bitcoin challenge.
                            <br/>
                            Basically, someone wanting to pass a transaction using the blockchain (our public ledger) needs to do some kind of computation that is actually very costly timewise. They can then add a block to the blockchain that validates a bunch of transactions. A direct consequence of this is that the bigger the computing power used for this task, the harder it is for a single actor to beat them at fullfilling it, simply because a single group or person can hardly possess enough computing power to beat the rest of the world.
                            <br/>
                            One more thing, we can make every block in the blockchain linked to the block before it so the state of the next block is dependent on the state of the whole chain. That way, nobody can modify previous blocks without invalidating the rest of the chain. We are now tamper proof!
                            <br/>
                            However, we still have a problem. People are not going to spend a bunch of time and energy to pass transactions for free, so we need to reward them. That's where the term "mining" comes from. Everytime somebody validates the challenge and appends a block to the chain, they can add a transaction to give themselves Bitcoins out of nowhere! This way they are properly rewarded for spending all of these resources.
                            <br/>

                            <p align="justify">
                            Because Bitcoin is essentially software, people are going to want to modify it in some way. However, it is unlikely that everybody is on board with every change so sometimes, we get a fork.
                            <br/>
                            A fork is basically a divergence in the blockchain due to some changes to the rules of the challenge used to reach consensus. There are two types of forks, hard forks and soft forks.
                            <br/>
                            Hard forks happen when the new clients (using the new rules) in the network reject the old ones (or vice-versa). So we essentially have a new currency that shares history with the first one. If everybody upgrades, then we're fine but if people disagree we might get some problems. We don't want people to be able to spend their past money twice after all.
                            <br/>
                            Soft forks are kind of like hard forks, except that we do not split the community in two parts hoping that either one changes their mind. We introduce new rules, and try to get a majority of the network to adopt them but still keep a way to be compatible with the protocol before the changes. That way we can easily introduce a new concept in the protocol without breaking everything.

                            The 15th of July 2017, the value of Bitcoin dropped. One of the main reasons is the first of August getting closer. At that time, Bitcoin was about to get an update. Miners would be able to fit more transactions inside of a single block which would bring the average time needed to validate transactions down. This change was backwards-compatible and can thus be called a soft fork. Nevertheless, uncertainty related to these changes had a negative impact on the currency.

                            Following a lot of discussions about Bitcoin and its relative sluggishness when compared to centralized banking systems, the community decided to try and make the system faster. The update we talked about in the previous paragraph sought to do this by changing the information contained inside of a block but another idea came about: make blocks bigger. Bitcoin Cash was born, a hard fork that allows its users to mine blocks about 8 times bigger than Bitcoin, which means 8 times as many transactions can be validated using a single block. The fork was deemed a failure by some parts of the community due to its poor initial adoption. In the weeks following its creation, Bitcoin Cash was nevertheless fighting toe to toe with Bitcoin in terms of profitability.

                            Bitcoin Gold is a fork that occured on the 23rd of October 2017. Its main goal was to create a Bitcoin resistant to ASICs (short for Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). ASICs are kind of like CPUs except that they are created for computing one specific task. That makes them incredibly efficient at it, so much in fact that some people feared its effect on Bitcoin. Some ASICs were created to compute the Bitcoin challenge and, with them, the big miners became even bigger, locking away the simple user with a general purpose computer.
                            <br/>
                            Bitcoin Gold changed the challenge needed to mine blocks to solve this. It actually borrowed theirs from another cryptocurrency called ZCash, that was itself created from a project inspired by Bitcoin. At this point however, Bitcoin Gold had no client and thus no way for people to start mining it.

                            The 8th of November 2017, after the announcement of yet another fork called SegWit2x, its deployment was cancelled. Because of tensions in the community related to this fork, the event appeased the minds of a lot of people. Bitcoin reached its peak value at the time. Because SegWit2x was supposed to make transactions faster, people supporting it falled back on Bitcoin Cash, strengthening it.

                            Just a few days later, during a weekend on the 12th of November 2017, Bitcoin Gold released its client. The new player in the game frightened the Bitcoin userbase. Promptly, the value of Bitcoin drops, reflecting this state of mind.
                            <br/>
                            It is interesting to note that, during this weekend, the hashrate (a way to measure the speed at which people are trying to solve the Bitcoin challenge) halved. It stands to reason that a lot of miners started to mine Bitcoin Gold using their existing hardware just in case it were to gain a lot of traction.

                                The growth of Bitcoin in 2017 has been impressive to say the least. Were're looking at a price of 16'858 USD for 1 BTC on the 7th December, even though it barely reached 1'000 USD in January.
                                However there's no telling how a popular fork could affect Bitcoin in 2018.
                                <br/>
                                Finally, with a currency inherently tied to technology and cryptography, any small advancement in these domains could cause either Bitcoin's rise or fall. Do not mistake Bitcoin for a safe bet.
